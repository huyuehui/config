# Portage Directories
# ===================
#
# Each of these settings controls an aspect of portage's storage and file
# system usage. If you change any of these, be sure it is available when
# you try to use portage. *** DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING "/" ***
#
# PORTAGE_TMPDIR is the location portage will use for compilations and
#     temporary storage of data. This can get VERY large depending upon
#     the application being installed.
PORTAGE_TMPDIR=/tmp
#
# PORTDIR is the location of the portage tree. This is the repository
#     for all profile information as well as all ebuilds. If you change
#     this, you must update your /etc/portage/make.profile symlink accordingly.
#     ***Warning***
#     Data stored inside PORTDIR is in peril of being overwritten or deleted by
#     the emerge --sync command. The default value of PORTAGE_RSYNC_OPTS
#     will protect the default locations of DISTDIR and PKGDIR, but users are
#     warned that any other locations inside PORTDIR are not necessarily safe
#     for data storage.

PORTDIR="/usr/portage"
# DISTDIR is where all of the source code tarballs will be placed for
#     emerges. After packages are built, it is safe to remove any and
#     all files from this directory since they will be automatically
#     fetched on demand for a given build. If you would like to
#     selectively prune obsolete files from this directory, see
#     eclean from the gentoolkit package.
DISTDIR="${PORTDIR}/distfiles"
# PKGDIR is the location of binary packages that you can have created
#     with '--buildpkg' or '-b' while emerging a package.
PKGDIR="${PORTDIR}/packages"

# MAKEOPTS provides extra options that may be passed to 'make' when a
#     program is compiled. Presently the only use is for specifying
#     the number of parallel makes (-j) to perform. The suggested number
#     for parallel makes is CPUs+1.
# ===================
MAKEOPTS="-j5"

# Portage uses GENTOO_MIRRORS to specify mirrors to use for source retrieval.
# The list is a space separated list which is read left to right. If you use
# another mirror we highly recommend leaving the default mirror at the end of
# the list so that portage will fall back to it if the files cannot be found
# on your specified mirror. We _HIGHLY_ recommend that you change this setting
# to a nearby mirror by merging and using the 'mirrorselect' tool.

# Synchronizing Portage
# =====================
#
# Each of these settings affects how Gentoo synchronizes your Portage tree.
# Synchronization is handled by rsync and these settings allow some control
# over how it is done.
#
# SYNC is the server used by rsync to retrieve a localized rsync mirror
#     rotation. This allows you to select servers that are geographically
#     close to you, yet still distribute the load over a number of servers.
#     Please do not single out specific rsync mirrors. Doing so places undue
#     stress on particular mirrors.  Instead you may use one of the following
#     continent specific rotations:
#
#   Default:       "rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   North America: "rsync://rsync.namerica.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   South America: "rsync://rsync.samerica.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   Europe:        "rsync://rsync.europe.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   Asia:          "rsync://rsync.asia.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
#   Australia:     "rsync://rsync.au.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"

#SYNC="rsync://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/gentoo-portage"
#SYNC="rsync://mirrors.163.com/gentoo-portage"
#SYNC="rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage"
